### Hey, I'm Lewis 👋

I am an app developer with over 3 years of experience in the field. My expertise lies in using C# and JavaScript in combination with technologies such as React, Unity, and .NET to develop high-quality applications that can run on different platforms.

Over the years, I have worked with clients from different industries, including education, fashion, and entertainment. I am always eager to take on new challenges and learn new technologies that can help me improve.

If you are looking for an app developer who can deliver high-quality solutions on time and within budget, look no further. I would be happy to discuss your project and provide a custom quote. Feel free to reach out to me anytime!

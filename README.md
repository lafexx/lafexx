### Hey, I'm Lewis 👋

I am a freelance cross-platform app developer with over 3 years of experience in the field. My expertise lies in using C# and JavaScript in combination with technologies such as React, Unity, and .NET to develop high-quality applications that can run on different platforms seamlessly.

I am passionate about creating intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing software solutions. My goal is to provide my clients with apps that are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. I believe that a good app should not only meet the client's needs but also exceed their expectations.

Over the years, I have worked with clients from different industries, including education, fashion, and entertainment. I am always eager to take on new challenges and learn new technologies that can help me improve my craft.

If you are looking for a freelance cross-platform app developer who can deliver high-quality solutions on time and within budget, look no further. I would be happy to discuss your project and provide a custom quote. Feel free to reach out to me anytime!
